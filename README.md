## Challenges

I encountered many challenges in this Challenge including, but not limited to:

- relearning CSS and how to write it
- trouble with creating new routes that weren't included in the module this Challenge was based off of
- This app has a lot of files to keep track of. It was really difficult to keep track of everything.
- I overcame these challenges with help from TA office hours, consulting the week 14 module, from group coding with other students, and focusing on small parts of the app at a time.
